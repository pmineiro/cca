ngram data from Google (http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html), version 20090715, American English

=== How to run the demo ===

1. cd data/; make
   -> downloads google n-grams and pre-processes, takes many hours
2. make sure you have compiled MEX *.cpp in parent directory
3. open matlab and run makeccangrams.m
   -> takes about 60 minutes and roughly 40 gigabytes of memory
4. embeddings are stored in megaproj.mat
5. query embeddings using the neighbors.py tool.  see examples in Makefile

embeddings exhibit ``linear semantics'', e.g.,

  * man + queen - king -> woman
  * go + walked - walk -> went
  * paris + germany - berlin -> france
  * poland + german - germany -> polish
  * bigger + small - big -> smaller
